        "in simple terms, Matrix multiplication combines two matrices by taking the dot product of each row of the first matrix with each column of the second, producing a new matrix.\n",
        "matrix multiplication is a little funky, ill walk you thru it. We start on this initial page, starting page if you will. Depicted in front of you is two sets of brackets the bracket on the left consists of a 3x3 array of numbers, you can adjust these numbers, you can also adjust the amount of numbers in this array. The known and loved multiplication sign lies in the middle of the two braackets, seperating left from right, lets get into the contents of the right bracket, this of which consists of a 3x2 array of numbers that are also customizable in terms of amounts and also the arrangement of the array. Then, youll click the button that says begin, the bracket on the right will travel upward and over the bracket on the left, so when looked at from afar, creates a 5x3 array of numbers, just sepearted by brackets! Lets click next, oh gosh this is getting difficult to explain, just stay with me now. ok so the column on the bottom of the 2x3 drops down, we then multiply those three numbers with the three numbers from the left row, and we take the sum of that and place it into a new BRACKET!! this of which is seperated by an equal sign. Click next again and the right (now top) bracket will drop once more, now youre multiplying the top row of the left column with the top row of the bottom column, and the bottom row of the right column with the middle row of the left column, all this to end up with a sum of a brand new bracket, that consists of a 3x2 array of numbers."
